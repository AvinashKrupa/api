            <p>We strive to provide premium services to our clients and connect the clients with the physicians of their choice in their desired and convenient timeslots. There can be a few circumstances when the client will not be able to connect with the physicians or the physician will not be able to fulfil his appointment. The below document tries to identify all possible circumstances in the aforementioned scenarios and devise a policy on redressing the grievances arising due to the same.</p>
            <div class="listpoint">
               <ol>
                  <li>For appointment booked by the patient which are from 3 days to 7days and beyond the scheduled appointment time, a 100% refund of the consulting fees will be done to the patient’s original source of payment within 72 business hours.</li>
                  <li> For appointment booked by the patient which are from 4 hours to 3 days before the scheduled appointment time, a 100% refund of the consulting fees will be made to the user’s wallet as “LiveMedic Credits” of the same value which the user can redeem for the same amount in the next consultation for any available physicians. The credits can be redeemed in full or can be used in parts. Ex: If the available credits are 500 and the next consultation is 200 Rs then the patient can use 200 credits and keep the remaining 300 credits for the next appointment. In case the next consultation fees is more than the available credits, the user can pay the balance with any preferred payment method and book the consultation. Ex. In the same scenario when the next consultation is 600 Rs, the patient can use the available 500 credits and pay the balance 100 Rs and book the consultation.</li>
                  <li> When the cancellation is done within 4 hours to two hours from the scheduled appointment, a cancellation fee of 50% of the consulting fees will be levied and the patient will be eligible for a 50% refund of their consulting fees. The refund will be processed within 72 business hours and returned to the original source of payment.</li>
                  <li>Any appointments cancelled 2 hours prior to the appointment schedule will not be eligible for a refund.</li>
               </ol>
            </div>

            <p> There will be certain circumstances when the patient will not be able to attend an appointment due to circumstances which are beyond their control or in some instances where they will not be able to join the video appointment. The patient can contact the customer care number of LiveMedic and inform the customer care team regarding the aforementioned circumstances and after due diligence they will be eligible for a complete refund of their consulting fees in the form of LiveMedic credits. The decision regarding the refund will be at the discretion of the management of LiveMedic Healthcare India Pvt Ltd and will be final and binding by all laws governing the Chennai High Court. In case of any disputes regarding the same, an arbitration committee consisting of three members designated by LiveMedic Healthcare India Pvt Ltd will scrutinize the case and will decide on the status of the grievance. All such arbitrations will be final and bound the current policies of LiveMedic Healthcare India Pvt Ltd within the jurisdiction of the Madras High Court.

</p>
            <h5>Fair Usage Policy:</h5>
            <p>There is a provision of awarding LiveMedic credits to the user’s wallet under certain cancellation clauses and circumstances. To ensure that the users do not take undue advantage of this feature, there will be a fair usage policy for the same. The users will be eligible for a maximum of three scheduled/planned and one unscheduled cancellation governed by the aforementioned terms and conditions. A user can avail a maximum of four cancellations in a calendar year from the date of the first cancellation. In the second instance of a planned/scheduled cancellation, the user will be notified with a notification of the fair usage policy through the app and via email, SMS and Whatsapp. A final notification will be sent to the user after S/he uses the scheduled/planned cancellation for the third time stating that the user has achieved the maximum number of permitted cancellations. The next time the user does a scheduled/planned cancellation, they will be temporarily blocked from using the app for a period of three months. If the user again does a planned/scheduled cancellation after they access the app, they will be blacklisted from the app and will not be allowed to access the services of LiveMedic permanently.


            </p>
            <p>In case of an emergency cancellation, the user will be reminded of the fair usage policy via SMS, Whatsapp and email after cancellation. The next time the user does an emergency cancellation, S/he will be blocked permanently from using the app and will not be able to use the services of LiveMedic. The LiveMedic management holds exclusive rights to decide on revoking the access of the users found to abuse the aforementioned cancellation system at their own discretion and judgement. The LiveMedic team may also decide to reinstate the access of the users if they find any validity for the emergency cancellations and this is decided based on the discretion of the LiveMedic management.
            </p>
            <h5>Cancellation policy for Doctors:</h5>
            <p>We understand that the partner physicians are engaged with their other commitments including physical clinics, OPD’s, OT’s and other emergencies and will sometimes not be able to fulfil their booked appointments. The partner physicians should strive to avoid such cancelations as it will adversely impact the patient’s impression of the physician’s availability for consultation and will result in fewer appointments similar to physical OPD consultations. In case the physician is unable to fulfil their booked appointments, they can opt for one of the below options:
            </p>
            <div class="listpoint">
               <ol>
                  <li>The physicians can call the customer care support number of LiveMedic in case of an emergency (OT emergencies, hospital emergencies etc.) and inform the team to either prepone, postpone or reschedule the booked appointments to a convenient time and date as per their revised availability.</li>
                  <li>The physicians can either prepone or postpone their appointments on the same day through the LiveMedic app in the manage appointments page. This should be done at least two hours prior to the scheduled appointment in case of postponements and four hours prior to the appointment in case of preponing the appointments. This ensures that the patient can be notified in advance about the revised appointment schedules. Preponing an appointment can be done up to a maximum of six hours before the scheduled original appointment.</li>
                  <li>
                     In case the patient is not available for the preponed/postponed appointment, the doctors can either schedule an appointment in the next day up to a time of seven days from the original appointment date. Ex: A patient has an appointment on 14th July 2021 at 5 PM which the doctor has accepted. The physician gets held up with an emergency and is not able to connect at 5 PM then S/he should reschedule the same appointment at 5 PM on 15th July 2021. This can be done till 21st July 2021. If in case the physician needs to prepone the appointment on the same day 14th July 2021, S/he has to change the appointment schedule no later than 11 AM on 14th July 2021 up to a time slot beginning from 1 PM on the same day. If the physician needs to postpone the appointment on 14th July 2021, they have to change the appointment schedule no later than 3 PM on 14th July 2021 to a timeslot of their convenience.
